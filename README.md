# Welcome

This repository contains a source	 files	 for	 all	 figures,	 simulated	 data,	 parameter	 fits	 and	 all	 source	 code
used	in	the	research project

[Signatures of criticality arise from random subsampling in simple population models](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005718)

You can find statistical methods and algorithms used in this projects as a [toolbox](https://github.com/mackelab/CorBinian/) that we hope can be of use for other projects that analyse multivariate binary datasets.

For reasons	 of	 transparency,	*this*	 repository	 is	 a	 direct	 copy	 of	 the	code used	internally within the	'criticality' project,	complete	with	the	full	and	raw	submission	history of	all	commits.	Given	that,	the	code	(found in the "code" folder) uses	absolute	pathnames	and	is included	as	it	was	run	on	our	workstation	and	on	our	compute-cluster.	It	is	likely	that	it	will	not	work	‘out	of	the	box’.

We	 have	 additionally	 uploaded	 the	 simulated	 data,	 source	 files	 with	 any	 data	that	went	into	any	figure	as	well	as	scripts	for	generating	raw	versions	of	all	figures. The figure scripts were updated to work with the file structure and should run out of the box when exectued from within the "figures" folder. 

The data and results files were uploaded using Git Large File Storage (https://git-lfs.github.com/).  Downloading the .mat and .gc files from this repository requires to install Git LFS. 

During the project, we generated long Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs that were used to gauge the gain in sampling effeciency obtained from Rao-Blackwellizing the Monte Carlo sampler. This repository only contains data on the quantified gain (i.e. the root mean square errors (RMSEs) referred to in the manuscript) computed from the sampled Monte Carlo chains, but not the raw Monte Carlo chains themselves (~4GB).

This repository also contains the code used to generate the activity of our simple simulated population of retinal ganglion cells, found under "data/data_generation/". This code can be readily used to generate additional simulated activity.
